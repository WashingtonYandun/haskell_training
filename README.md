# haskell_training

My first steps to haskell lang

-   I will be solving some problems from project euler in order to learn haskell (Not all of them, just a few)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Am learning haskell, so this repository will be used to store my progress and some exercises that I will be solving.
> The main goal is to learn haskell and functional programming.
> The exercises will be from project euler and some other sources.

> [!WARNING]
> The solutions on here are not the best, but they are the best I could do at the time.
> I will be improving them as I learn more about haskell.
